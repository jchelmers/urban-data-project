This directory contains the data files and Jupyter notebook needed to count the number of 311 complaints of certain types within a 0.3km radius of each restaurant in our dataset within the last year.

We include these types of complaints: “Food Establishment,” “Food Poisoning,” “Rodent,” “Dirty Conditions,” “Missed Trash Collection,” “Electricity,” “Safety,” “Police Matter” or “General.”

Before running the **Count_311_Complaints.ipynb** notebook, please download the following files:
* "311_Service_Requests_from_last_year_filtered.csv** This file is too big to add to this repo, but can be downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9. To replicate our results (and reduce the time the notebook takes to run), use the NYC OpenData interactive filtering tool to filter for the complaint types listed above and to only include 311 calls between May 5, 2016, and March 22, 2017. The file should be saved in the same directory as this notebook and with the given file name.
* **health_inspect_cleaned_loc_added.csv** Available in this repo at https://github.com/jchelmers/urban-data-project/tree/master/Geocoding. When you download this file, please retain the directory structure of the GitHub, i.e. this file should be downloaded into a directory named Geocoding located at ../Geocoding relative to this directory.

The notebook will create a CSV named **vdf_with_complaints.csv** in the working directory. This file contains the cleaned restaurant dataset, including latitude and longitude, with additional columns for the number of recent 311 complaints of each type within a 0.3km radius.
