# urban-data-project

This repo contains our code and data files for the final project for the DS-GA 1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics course taught by Professor David Rosenberg (NYU, Spring 2017). We were advised by Dr. Bonnie Ray.

For our project, we predicted the probability of a New York City restaurant exhibiting two or more critical food safety violations on its next inspection, using data from the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 311 Services, Department of Consumer Affairs, New York State Liquor Authority, Weather Underground, OpenStreetMap, and Google Places.

Each subfolder contains a README with instructions on how to replicate our results.
