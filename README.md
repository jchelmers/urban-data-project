# urban-data-project

This repo contains our code and data files for the final project for the DS-GA 1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics course taught by Professor David Rosenberg (NYU, Spring 2017). We were advised by Dr. Bonnie Ray.

For our project, we classified New York City restaurants according to their probability of exhibiting two or more critical food safety violations on their next inspection, using data from the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 311 Services, Department of Consumer Affairs, New York State Liquor Authority, Weather Underground, OpenStreetMap, and Google Places.

The subfolders contain READMEs with instructions on how to replicate our results.
