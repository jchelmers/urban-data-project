This notebook contains the code and data files needed to genereate the map of modeling predictions (true positives, false positives, and false negatives) that appears in our **Predicting Food Safety Violations** report.

Before running the MATLAB script **visualization.m**, please download the following files:
* **RF_testset_for_heatmap.csv** Available in this repo at: https://github.com/jchelmers/urban-data-project/tree/master/Heatmap
* **wms.mat** Available in this repo at: https://github.com/jchelmers/urban-data-project/tree/master/Heatmap

Both files should be downloaded into the same directory as the MATLAB script.

The MATLAB script will create the file **violations.mat** in the working directory.
